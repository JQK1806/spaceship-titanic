# spaceship-titanic

This project uses machine learning to determine whether a passenger was transported to another dimension, based on the Kaggle competition found at [Spaceship Titanic on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).

## About
This repository contains code and resources for the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension using passenger data. The project leverages Python and data science libraries for data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spaceship-titanic.git
   cd spaceship-titanic
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Place the Kaggle competition data files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`) in the project directory.

## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb`- Main notebook for data analysis and modeling
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Project documentation
